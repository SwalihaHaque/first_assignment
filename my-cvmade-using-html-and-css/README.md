# My CV - made using HTML and CSS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Swaliha-Haque/pen/poZYQRa](https://codepen.io/Swaliha-Haque/pen/poZYQRa).

This is my first implementation. I learnt CSS on 15 Jun 2013 at Codecademy.com and as a final project titled "Build your resume!" I took it seriously and decided to go on creating my own Resume using my CSS / HTML knowledge so far (whatever gained from Codecademy.com)
